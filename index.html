                 <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the markup for a website where all the typing goes, declaration of classes go. HTML is the base of websites and pages. We can't have websites without HTML. HTML is like the bread of a sandwitch.</p>

                    <p>Ever seen beautiful websites? Ever seen eye-catching web pages? CSS does the work. It stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS designs web pages to look pretty and beautiful. CSS makes work look more attractive than a normal piece of HTML bread. CSS is the meat, cheese and tomatoes of a sandwitch. Some CSS libraries and frameworks include Sass, SCSS, materialize.css etc. </p>

                    <p>JavaScript is the hands and legs of websites. In other words, JavaScript is the functionality of websites. JavaScript makes websites interactive, responsive and user-friendly. There are a lot of JavaScript libraries like React.js, Vanilla.js, Angular.js, Vue.js etc</p>
